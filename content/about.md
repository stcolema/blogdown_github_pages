My research interests include Bayesian clustering applied to 'omics data to 
extract biological information. Within 'omics we have huge quantities of data; 
interpreting this and creating a coherent story of disease is a non-tirivial 
problem. My aim is to use Bayesian clustering methods (particularly 
non-parametric methods) in the area of immunology to help contribute to the
understanding of disease. Previously I have worked with [**Paul Kirk**](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/paul-kirk/),
[**Laurent Gatto**](https://lgatto.github.io/) and [**Ollie Crook**](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/a-to-g/oliver-crook/)
to extend Multiple Dataset Integration (**MDI**), an unsupervised clustering 
method based upon Dirichlet processes, to a semi-supervised predictive tool in 
spatial proetomics. This is available online in 
[`tagm-mdi`](https://github.com/stcolema/tagmmdi). Currently I am working  with 
[**Chris Wallace**](http://chr1swallace.github.io), to apply MDI to gene 
expression data across multiple tissue types.
