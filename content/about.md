My research interests include Bayesian clustering applied to 'omics data to 
extract biological information. Within 'omics we have huge quantities of data; 
interpreting this and creating a coherent story of disease is a non-tirivial 
problem. My aim is to use Bayesian clustering methods (particularly 
non-parametric methods), specifically in the area of immunology as part of my 
work with [**Chris Wallace**](http://chr1swallace.github.io), 
to help contribute to the understanding of disease.
