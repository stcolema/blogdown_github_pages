      <description>Prelude Many of the R snippets below require these R packages (Kolde 2019, Dowle and Srinivasan (2019), Neuwirth (2014)):
library(pheatmap) library(data.table) library(RColorBrewer)  Reading Inital work involved reading Mason et al. (2016) and reading the manual of the associated program. Expecting that this would have difficulties scaling (based on Paul’s beliefs from November) to nine datasets different sampling methods were researched (Bardenet, Doucet, and Holmes 2017). Hamiltonian Monte Carolo appears a likely candidate to improve the rate of convergence, with Betancourt (2017) providing an explanation of the theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>My research interests include Bayesian clustering applied to &amp;lsquo;omics data to extract biological information. Within &amp;lsquo;omics we have huge quantities of data; interpreting this and creating a coherent story of disease is a non-tirivial problem. My aim is to use Bayesian clustering methods (particularly non-parametric methods) in the area of immunology to help contribute to the understanding of disease. Previously I have worked with Paul Kirk, Laurent Gatto and Ollie Crook to extend Multiple Dataset Integration (MDI), an unsupervised clustering method based upon Dirichlet processes, to a semi-supervised predictvie tool in spatial proetomics.</description>
