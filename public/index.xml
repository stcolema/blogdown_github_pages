      <description>Prelude Many of the R snippets below require these R packages (Kolde 2019, Dowle and Srinivasan (2019), Neuwirth (2014)):
library(pheatmap) library(data.table) library(RColorBrewer)  MDI Reading Inital work involved reading Mason et al. (2016) and reading the manual of the associated program. Expecting that this would have difficulties scaling (based on Paulâ€™s beliefs from November) to nine datasets different sampling methods were researched (Bardenet, Doucet, and Holmes 2017). Hamiltonian Monte Carolo appears a likely candidate to improve convergence, with Betancourt (2017) providing an explanation of the theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>My research interests include Bayesian clustering applied to &amp;lsquo;omics data to extract biological information. Within &amp;lsquo;omics we have huge quantities of data; interpreting this and creating a coherent story of disease is a non-tirivial problem. My aim is to use Bayesian clustering methods (particularly non-parametric methods), specifically in the area of immunology as part of my work with Chris Wallace, to help contribute to the understanding of disease.</description>
