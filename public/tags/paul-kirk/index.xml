      <description>Summary This period has been a bit strange - the Easter bank holiday, MASAMB and a wedding in Ireland saw a number of days lost for MDI work (approximately 10). What have we done in this period:
Run MATLAB MDI on the small gene sets (n = 102 probes) across 7 key datasets (we dropped CD15 and PLA); Ran Many seeds MDI (this is Mason’s implementation using multiple start points) on the same data; and Inspected and compared outputs.</description>

      <description>Sensible Clustering We check if the modal cluster from the MDI iterations is a sensible decision for allocating probes (note: we referred to median clustering previously. This was wrong). To do this we construct heatmaps comparing the clustering across a sample of iterations and also plot the adjusted Rand index for the clustering at every iteration compared to the modal clustering.
 We plot the adjusted Rand index comparing the allocation at a given iteration (corrected for thinning on the x-axis) to the modal clustering from all recorded iterations.</description>

      <description>Multiple Dataset Integration If we have observed paired datasets \(X_1=(x_{1,1},\ldots, x_{n,1})\), \(X_2=(x_{1,2},\ldots, x_{n,2})\), where observations in the \(i\)th row of each dataset represent information about the same individual. We would like to cluster using information common to both datasets. One could concatenate the datasets, adding additional covariates for each individual. However, if the two datasets have different clustering structures this would reduce the signal of both clusterings and probably have one dominate.</description>
