      <description>Prelude Many of the R chunks below require these R packages (Kolde 2019, Dowle and Srinivasan (2019), Neuwirth (2014)):
library(pheatmap) library(data.table) library(RColorBrewer)  Reading The first step in the project is to understand the tool we are using. Therefore a study of Mason et al. (2016) and reading the manual of the associated program were the first steps. Expecting that this would have difficulties scaling to nine datasets different sampling methods were researched (Bardenet, Doucet, and Holmes 2017).</description>

      <description>Multiple Dataset Integration If we have observed paired datasets \(X_1=(x_{1,1},\ldots, x_{n,1})\), \(X_2=(x_{1,2},\ldots, x_{n,2})\), where observations in the \(i\)th row of each dataset represent information about the same individual. We would like to cluster using information common to both datasets. One could concatenate the datasets, adding additional covariates for each individual. However, if the two datasets have different clustering structures this would reduce the signal of both clusterings and probably have one dominate.</description>
