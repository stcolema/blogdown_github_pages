Therefore a study of Mason et al. (2016) and reading the manual of the associated program were the first steps. Expecting that this would have difficulties scaling to nine datasets different sampling methods were researched (Bardenet, Doucet, and Holmes 2017). Hamiltonian Monte Carlo appears a likely candidate to improve the rate of convergence, with Betancourt (2017) providing an explanation of the theoretical framework. These topics were of interest as the MDI implementation uses a Gibbs sampler. We expected that we could make gains in the computational tractability of using all 9 datasets in a single call of MDI with a more clever sampling method.\n Data handling MDI uses data that has common row names across all datasets. The data from the CEDAR cohort is in the form of [people \\(\\times\\) probes]. We want to transpose this; to accomplish this task we wrote an Rscript that can be called form the terminal command line with appropriate arguments to transpose .csv files in a given directory. The data.table package by Dowle and Srinivasan (2019) was of great use in making this quick to run - for our 9 datasets of ~300 people and 8-16 thousand probes it aaproximately 30s using a desktop compuer to read in, transpose, handle missingness and write the file. In comparison, using purrr of the tidyverse suite for even one aspect of the missingness handling increased the time taken to roughly 1 minute 50s.\nThe nine datasets present are six circulating immune cell types (CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes, CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, platelets) as well as ileal, colonic, and rectal biopsies (IL, TR, RE datasets respectively).\nAnother script was required to remove all the non-ubiquitous probe IDs. Any probe not present in all datasets was removed to allow MDI to perform as MDI cannot handle missing data. This reduced the set of probes to 4,964.\nWe performed MDI on these 9 reduced datasets with 10,000 iterations, a burn-in of 1,000 and a thinning rate of 25. MDI overfits the data, beginning with 50 clusters (as an approximation of a Dirichlet process - note that we can change the number of clusters present); as part of the sampling is reduced to around 10 occupied clusters per dataset (ranging from 8 - 13). We assumed that the median cluster allocation was the predicted cluster forgetting about the label-flipping problem of unsupervised methods.\nWe constructed a dataframe of the median allocation per dataset for each probe. The probes are translated to the associated gene using the key available online. As some of the probes mapped to non-unique genes we use a matrix to hold our data (as this does not require unique row names in R). We read this in and visually inspect the head of the data.\n# Read in the data and convert to a matrix with apporpriate row names compare_df \u0026lt;- data.table::fread(\u0026quot;allocation_data_run_1.csv\u0026quot;) compare_df_mat \u0026lt;- as.matrix(compare_df[, -10]) row.names(compare_df_mat) \u0026lt;- compare_df$V1 # Inspect the data head(compare_df_mat) ## CD14 CD15 IL CD4 CD8 CD19 PLA RE TR ## GGACT 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ## A4GNT 5 6 10 6 6 10 5 5 5 ## AAAS 3 8 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 ## AACS 8 10 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ## AACSP1 8 6 6 6 8 8 5 6 6 ## NCEH1 10 8 10 10 10 10 8 11 10  Visualisation Note: As one inspects the following plots please recall that the labels are arbitrary and proximity of colouring has no significance (i.e. there is no reason to believe that orange in the heatplots has any association with red).\nUsing this data we generated a heatmap of all the genes allocation across all datasets.\nNotice that we have clusters of datasets; CD4, CD8 and CD14, RE and IL and then CD15, CD19 and TR. Platelets are outside of any clusters of datasets; PLA is also the thinnest dataset with only 8 thousand probes present in the full format.\nThere are 13 clusters present here; to enable comparison we went for a wider colour palette. This is the reason for the garishness of this heatplot. A casual inspection suggests lower similarity than one might expect, particularly considering the selection of data. As we only include the genes that are sufficiently expressed in each cell type to register for measurement we would expect these to include the genes that are most similarly expressed across all tissues. We should consider the pssibility that this is an artifact of not considering label-flipping, but we investigate the clusters in finer detail first.\nInvestigate different combinations We consider the data excluding the platelets. Even this change gives an appearance of greater similarity.\nRecalling the first heatmap of the entire dataset, which included clustering of columns (i.e. the datasets), we consider only the separate clustering of datasets: CD4, CD8, CD14, RE and IL.\nThese are more coherent than our first heatmap where we considered all datasets at once - this suggests that trying to process the output of all 9 datasets at once is a non-trivial task and the naive method of heatmapping all of the data is unlikey to be useful. However, by including clustering of the datasets it is a useful initial step in the exploratory data analysis and will be considered as part of our analysis workflow.\nOut of curiousity we check the clustering and heatmap for the excluded datasets.\nUnsurprisingly this is very noisy, with only small bands of genes clustering across multiple tissues.\n  Including all probes Next we attempt to include all probes present across the 9 datasets. The challenge here is to impute the missing probes in such a fashion as to not add noise to the final clustering. To do this we first inspect the spread of the expression values in the datasets. As this is too large to consider in normal summary statistics, we inspect histograms of these - we notice that all of the probe expression values have very similar means and standard deviations - these are densely (i.e. within 1.0 for the mean, within 0.2 for the standard deviation) distributed around 7.0 and 2.10 respectively.\nWe created an Rscript that finds the list of all unique probe IDs present across the 9 datasets and adds the required rows to each .csv file (filled with 0’s but any arbitrarily distant number from the range inhabitated by the actual measurements should be acceptable) and rearranging to have common row names and row orders in each dataset for all 18,517 prob IDs. Using these new datasets we perform MDI with the same arguments.\nThis script also saves a binary matrix indicating for each probe which datasets it is present in. We use this as part of a sense check to ensure that the cluster containing the imputed probes contains no other members. This is done by taking the Hadamard product of the binary matrix with the allocation matrix and comparing the clusters occupied in this to those of the allocation matrix. Ideally one of the clusters should have completed disappeared and been replaced by a 0 cluster. This is the case below.\nAs in the initial attempt we feed in our data and move the to a matrix format.\n# Read in the data and convert to a matrix with apporpriate row names compare_df_all \u0026lt;- data.table::fread(\u0026quot;allocation_data_run_2.csv\u0026quot;) compare_df_all_mat \u0026lt;- as.matrix(compare_df_all[, -10]) row.names(compare_df_all_mat) \u0026lt;- compare_df_all$V1 We now create a heatmap of these genes.\nNotice the clustering of datasets; we have groupings of the intestinal sample cells (IL, RE and TR), of CD14, CD19, CD4 and CD8 and then CD15 and platelets on their own.\n# Subset the similar datasets cd_subset \u0026lt;- c(1, 3, 4, 5) intestine_subset \u0026lt;- c(6, 8, 9) The grey areas are absent genes for the dataset in question. This is too dense (being some 18,517 observations long) and with the dissmilarity of some features make it impossible to see patterns.\nHOX gene clusters We investigate the clustering of HOX genes; these are a family of associated genes. We expect to see them cluster together in each dataset.\nWe see that for the HOX genes present in all datasets we have the majority in a common cluster across datasets, particularly in the blood cell types. There is slightly less homogeneity in the intestinal samples. We check to see if the clustering is more unanimous in the subsets of similar datasets.\nRecalling the clustering of datasets from the initial heatmap, we investigate these groupings. We inspect different combinations trying the CD combinations and the intestinal combinations.\nTo show that platelets and CD15 do not sit natually in any clustering of datasets we include the following heatmaps. The sparseness of the platelets dataset causes confusion and CD15 does not sit naturally in either clustering.\n  References Bardenet, Rémi, Arnaud Doucet, and Chris Holmes. 2017. “On Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Tall Data.” The Journal of Machine Learning Research 18 (1).

We would like to cluster using information common to both datasets. One could concatenate the datasets, adding additional covariates for each individual. However, if the two datasets have different clustering structures this would reduce the signal of both clusterings and probably have one dominate. If the two datasets have the same structure but different signal-to-noise ratios this would reduce the signal in the final clustering. In both these cases independent models on each dataset would be preferable. Kirk et al. (2012) suggest a method to carry out clustering on both datasets where common information is used but two individual clusterings are outputted. This method is driven by the allocation prior:\n\\[p(c_{i,1}, c_{i,2} | \\phi ) \\propto \\pi_{i,1} \\pi_{i,2} ( 1 + \\phi \\mathbb{I} ( c_{i,1} = c_{i,2}))\\]\nHere \\(\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\) controls the strength of association between datasets. The above equation states that the probability of allocating individual \\(i\\) to component \\(c_{i,1}\\) in dataset 1 and to component \\(c_{i,2}\\) in dataset 2 is proportional to the proportion of these components within each dataset and up-weighted by \\(\\phi\\) if the individual has the same labelling in each dataset. Thus as \\(\\phi\\) grows the correlation between the clusterings grow and we are more likely to see the same clustering emerge from each dataset.
